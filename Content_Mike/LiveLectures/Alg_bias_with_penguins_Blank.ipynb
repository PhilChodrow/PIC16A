    "Many popular machine algorithms are affected by issues of bias. For example, facial recognition algorithms often work better on people with lighter skin than on people with darker skin. The potential harm is massive. For example, someone could be wrongly arrested because of faulty facial recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possible sources of these issues, but one notable source is bias in the training data. For example, many computer vision algorithms are trained on majority white datasets which leads to them working well for white people but poorly for people of color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will illustrate this issue through a somewhat silly example. We will consider a data set containing biological measurements of penguins belonging to three different species and will train a model to predict which species a given penguin is. When the training data is evenly divided amongst male and female penguins, the model will preform equally well for both sexes. However, this will change if we make the dataset predominantly male, it will not work well when we test it on female penguins."
