    "    a SubtractionDict includes all properties and methods of the dict class. \n",
    "    Additionally, implements dictionary subtraction via the - binary operator. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If SD1 and SD2 are both SubtractionDicts whose values are numbers (ints or floats),\n",
    "    and if all values in SD1 are larger than their corresponding values in SD2, \n",
    "    then SD1 - SD2 is a new SubtractionDict whose keys are the keys of SD1 and whose values\n",
    "    are the difference in values between SD1 and SD2. Keys present in SD1 but not in SD2 are \n",
    "    handled as though they are present in SD2 with value 0. \n",

    "    2. The result of subtraction would result in negative values. \n",
