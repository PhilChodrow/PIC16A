    "In this activity, we'll work in groups to write a very simple version of the game [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). As you may know, Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game. \n",

    "- Player 2 places an O in one of the remaining 8 grid squares.\n",
    "- The players alternate until no grid squares remain. \n",
    "- A player wins if any row, column, or diagonal contains 3 copies of their symbol; if no player wins, the game ends in a draw. Here is an example of a game in which the O player has won (on the diagonal) after the 6th turn. \n",

    "This activity will ask you to write a single, large chunk of code, which may appear somewhat disorganized. In future lectures, we'll discuss *functions*, which offer convenient ways to break large operations into simpler operations that are easier to manage. "
