    "Welcome to PIC16A! I’m Professor Michael Perlmutter, your instructor, and I’m grateful that you’re here. Before we dive into the details, I want to lay out some guiding principles for this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) __I want you to succeed.__ The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, __you__) can learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) __None of us signed up for remote learning.__ We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these difficult times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __Your wellbeing comes first.__ If your wellbeing or that of a loved one comes into conflict with course obligations, I hope that you will attend to the former.  If you anticipate extended difficulties related to participation or assignments, reach out to me at the earliest opportunity. We’ll make it happen.\n",

    "\n",
    "I do not grade on the basis of ranks or other distributional information. Your final letter grade in this course is a reflection of your own effort, learning, and teamwork. If every student fully meets my expectations along these axes, then I will not hesitate to give every student an A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, your final letter grade in PIC16A is based on the following two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your final course average. I use the straight scale as a minimum, and reserve the right to be more generous. For example, if you achieve a final average of a 92 in the course, that guarantees you at least an A-. The only exception is the A+ grade, which is not guaranteed by any numerical average. I am very stingy with these and only give them out to students who have shown exceptional teamwork and creativity, in addition to ending the quarter with a very high average.\n",
    "- My professional assessment of your learning. This is the “extra” that could push that A- to an A. You will have an opportunity on the final exam to reflect on your time in the course and share with me any information about your learning that may not be reflected in your numerical average.\n",
    "Thus, you are not competing against your peers for grades. This means that you don’t hurt your own prospects when you help your peers understand a concept. Indeed, just the opposite, when reasonably possible, I will reward exceptional collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are all on the same team here."

    "\n",
    "Late homework will be accepted up to three days late. Assignments which are less than 24 hours late will receive a ten point penalty. Assigments which are less than 48 hours late will receive a twenty point penalty, and assigments which are less than 72 hours late will receive a 30 point penalty. If you have extenuating circumstances, such as a hospitilization, which prevent you from completing an assignment on time, please contact me as soon as possible.

Scheduled lecture sessions will include Q&A, discussion, supplementary lectures, and both individual and group activities.\n",

The lowest four grades from discussion assignments will be dropped. You are expected to consult the expectations for working in groups prior to the first Discussion section of the quarter.\n",

Your essay should address a concrete problem, assess the current state of affairs, and suggest one or more paths forward. Examples of suitable topics include but are no means limited to, i) bias in facial recognition, ii) the impact of automation on social services for the poor, and iii) the role of technology in combatting climate change. Please note that you should pick a specific topic and not just write about the general impact of social media or tech companies on society as a whole. Essays on such general topics will likely receive only partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to argue any angle on your topic, provided that you can offer sound sources and argumentation. For example, you may argue that bias in facial recognition is a major problem in need of solution, or you may argue that no substantial problem exists. You are welcome to ask me about your sources and proposed argument before you begin writing. Similarly, if you are not sure if you topic is specific enough, please ask before you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "This essay will be graded out of 2 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 1.5 points, 1.5% will be added to your final average. Please note that, because 2% is quite a lot of extra credit, I will tend to grade these essays quite strictly. Exceptional effort is required if you want all the full 2 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your essay should satisfy the following criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sources:__ The essay should cite and elaborate on at least five news articles, scholarly journal articles, or other primary sources. Opinion articles do not count. Blog posts are generally unsuitable, but posts by established experts may be permissible; ask me if you’re not sure. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you’re not sure which one to use, APA and MLA are both good choices. Up to one source may be a documentary film, while the remainder must be written. You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, you may email me for useful starting places.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Argument:__ The essay should have a thesis statement, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.\n",
    "-  While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Grammar and Writing:__ Your essay should be written in grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation.\n",

    "The Undergraduate Writing Center is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Campus Wire\n",
