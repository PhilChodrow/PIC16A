    "## We Are All On The Same Team\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not grade on the basis of ranks or other distributional information. Your final letter grade in this course is a reflection of your own effort, learning, and teamwork. If every student fully meets my expectations along these axes, then I will not hesitate to give every student an A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, your final letter grade in PIC16A is based on the following two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your final course average.__ I use the straight scale as a minimum, and reserve the right to be more generous. For example, if you achieve a final average of a 92 in the course, that guarantees you at least an A-. The only exception is the A+ grade, which is not guaranteed by any numerical average. I am very stingy with these and only give them out to students who have shown exceptional teamwork and creativity, in addition to ending the quarter with a very high average.\n",
    "\n",
    "__My professional assessment of your learning.__ This is the “extra” that could push that A- to an A. You will have an opportunity on the final exam to reflect on your time in the course and share with me any information about your learning that may not be reflected in your numerical average. Thus, you are not competing against your peers for grades. This means that you don’t hurt your own prospects when you help your peers understand a concept. Indeed, just the opposite – when reasonably possible, I will reward exceptional collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Effort\n",
    "Every student will need a different amount of time each week to maintain the brisk pace of this course. That said, this is a pretty intense class, and you should be prepared to devote a considerable amount of time to it. I expect that most students will need something like 10-12 hours a week for this class, on average. That will be less in some weeks, and more in a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re spending much longer than that, it’s ok! There’s nothing wrong, and I believe you can succeed in the course. Please reach out to me if you’re concerned about the amount of time you’re spending on this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework\n",
    "There will be weekly homework assignments throughout the quarter. You should consult the coding expectations and expectations for submitted assignments for guidance on how to polish, document and submit your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework assignments can be pretty challenging in this course. Some of them might require 5 or more hours to complete. Please start early and ask for help to make sure you can complete a high-quality assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest homework score will be dropped. Homeworks can be submitted up to 3 days late, at a discount of 10% per 24 hours past the deadline. For example, if you turn in a homework 20 hours late that would have received a 98%, your grade will be an 88%. If you turned it in 39 hours late your grade would be a 78%, and so on. Homeworks turned in more than 3 days (72 hours) late will receive 0% unless you’ve received an extension from me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Attendance at scheduled lecture sessions is encouraged but optional. You can achieve a 100% in this course without ever attending a scheduled lecture section. Of course, attendance at lecture will help you learn the material more rapidly and thoroughly. Scheduled lecture sessions will include Q&A, discussion, supplementary lectures, and both individual and group activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Attendance at Discussion sessions is expected.__ What “expected” means is that Discussion activities count toward your overall grade. Therefore, you must regularly attend discussion in order to get 100% in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under certain circumstances, you can receive an exemption which will allow you not to attend the scheduled Discussion section. You should request an exemption from me if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are in a timezone outside the U.S. that makes attendance at the scheduled times disruptive to your sleep schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You are concerned for the health of yourself or your loved ones, and therefore do not feel safe attending a course activity in person.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, I will match you with a group of students in a similar situation. You will be responsible for working out an alternative meeting time over Zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Discussion sections will include graded group work__, including exercises and creative problem-solving. This graded work is the basis of your participation score. Your Discussion activities are graded on participation: if you’ve put in 50 minutes of solid effort, you’ll get full credit. Generally, you’ll only receive less than full credit if you didn’t attend Discussion (in which case you’ll receive a 0 for that day). The lowest four grades from discussion assignments will be dropped. You are expected to consult the expectations for working in groups prior to the first Discussion section of the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Missing a Discussion Section:__ Generally speaking, if you miss a Discussion section, you can simply use one of your drops. It is still advisable to review the material, but your grade will not be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know of a conflict with your scheduled Discussion in advance, you can contact your group. If your group unanimously agrees, you may (a) notify the TA and (b) meet outside your scheduled Discussion section that day. You will still need to submit the worksheet by the stated deadline on CCLE, which is usually 24 hours after Discussion A begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizzes\n",
    "All traditional lectures will be pre-recorded and available online. Each lecture day, there will be a quiz consisting of questions related to that day’s lecture videos and required readings. The primary purpose of the quizzes is to encourage you to study the required lecture content in time to apply your knowledge in the group Discussion sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quizzes are are expected to take 15 minutes. However, I will set the timer for 45 minutes in order to alleviate any time pressure. They are due at 10:00am on the day following lecture. For example, a typical quiz corresponding to Wednesday’s lecture might consist of 2-3 questions, and can be taken in any contiguous 30-minute period that ends before 10:00am the following Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest 5 quiz grades will be dropped. Lectures, lecture notes, and required readings will always be posted at least 48 hours before the quiz is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a group project due at the end of the course. Working with your group, you will produce a small data science project in which you will read, explore, train machine learning models, and communicate your findings using a real data set. Several Discussion sections in the second half of the course will be devoted to helping you get started on the stages of this project. The project will be designed to require approximately 3-5 person-hours per group member outside of scheduled class times. It will be possible to start on the project by the end of Week 7, and you will have all the tools you need to finish the project by the end of Week 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Midterm Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "The midterm exam will take place on the Monday of Week 6. It will be released at 8am, Pacific Time, and will be due 24 hours later at 7:59am, Pacific Time, on the following Tuesday. The exam is intended to require approximately ninety minutes of effort, but you are free to spend more time on it within the 24 hours. This exam is open-book and open-notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "The final exam for this course will take place during the standard final exam period, at the time determined by the Registrar’s office. The final exam is not a coding exam. Instead, you’ll be asked to write very short essays on topics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Key concepts in machine learning.\n",
    "2. Algorithmic bias and the limitations of machine learning.\n",
    "3. Your role in the project, and what you learned from your experience.\n",
    "4. This exam is not intended to be “tricky.” If you’ve been following lectures and actively participating in your group project, you should do fine.\n",

    "## Essay\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time prior to the end of instruction, you may submit an essay of between 600 and 900 words (2-3 double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. Your essay should address a concrete problem, assess the current state of affairs, and suggest one or more paths forward. Examples of suitable topics related to algorithms and justice include but are no means limited to bias in facial recognition, the impact of automation on social services for the poor, and the role of technology in combatting climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure whether your topic is appropriate? A good topic will usually include the following two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Concrete benefits or harms.__ Examples of concrete benefits or harms include changes to one’s likelihood of being arrested, granted health services, approved for a loan, or granted reasonably-priced health insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Disparate impacts.__ You should show that the system in question harms or benefits certain groups more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "__A bad example:__ arguing that social media is driving political polarization. This is an interesting topic, but it does not describe concrete benefits or harms, nor does it describe disparate impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "__A better example:__ arguing that polarization on social media is leading to an increase in hate crimes (concrete harm) toward specific marginalized groups (disparate impact).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that questions of equity and justice are more specific than the general impact of social media or tech companies on society as a whole. Essays on such general topics will receive only partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to argue any angle on your topic, provided that you can offer sound sources and argumentation. For example, you may argue that bias in facial recognition is a major problem in need of solution, or you may argue that no substantial problem exists. You are welcome to ask me about your sources and proposed argument before you begin writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. Please note that, because 3% is quite a lot of extra credit, I will tend to grade these essays quite strictly. Exceptional effort is required if you want all three points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your essay should satisfy the following criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sources:__ The essay should cite and elaborate on at least four news articles, scholarly journal articles, or other primary sources. Opinion articles do not count. Blog posts are generally unsuitable, but posts by established experts may be permissible; ask me if you’re not sure. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you’re not sure which one to use, APA and MLA are both good choices. Up to one source may be a documentary film, while the remainder must be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Argument:__ The essay should have a thesis statement, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements:\n",
    "Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.\n",
    "Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.\n",
    "While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Grammar and Writing:__ Your essay should be written in grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation.\n",
    "The Undergraduate Writing Center is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to email me for suggestions on sources \n",
    "\n",
    "## Campuswire\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a Campuswire discussion forum associated with this course, where you can post both questions and answers about the course content.

    "\n",
    "## Student Hours\n",
    "You can get extra credit just by coming to Student Hours! The first time you attend OH and ask me a question, you will receive 0.25% extra credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Feedback\n",
    "There will be several surveys throughout the quarter which allow you to give me feedback on the course. Completing these feedback surveys is worth 0.25% extra credit, each.\n",
