    "# Coding Expectations\n",
    "On this page, I outline my primary expectations for your submitted programming assignments at various points in the quarter. You may find it useful to check the expectations for submitted assignments for concrete instructions on how to turn in work in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a creative endeavor, and there are usually multiple good ways to solve a problem. As programmers, we have the responsibility of not only solving the problem at hand but also doing so in a way that is logical, performant, documented, and easy to read. Users of your code—likely including your future self—will appreciate time you put into polishing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond pure correctness, there are three primary axes along which you should evaluate your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) __Style__: is my code as concise as it reasonably can be? Are any parts of my code redundant? Am I unnecessarily repeating any computational operations? Would someone who has never seen my code before be able to read my program? If I do need to perform the same task multiple times, can I wrap it inside a function or a for-loop? Am I making full appropriate use of the tools covered in the course so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) __Documentation__: does my code include helpful comments to guide the reader? Do my functions and classes possess docstrings? When the assignment requires, have I included sufficient surrounding text to explain my thought process?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __Robustness__: does my program check user inputs and produce informative error messages if inappropriate inputs are supplied? Does my code include unit tests that guarantee the correct operation of important components?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will place the most emphasis on style and documentation. Expectations on these axes will be in force on most assignments. Certain assignments will ask you to focus on robustness as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "My expectations of you will evolve as you develop your Python programming skills. Here’s where I expect you to be at various checkpoints in the quarter. These expectations stack, so the expectations at Week 7 also include those from earlier weeks.\n"

Your docstring should be sufficient to explain to a user what your function does, even if they have never seen it before.\n",
