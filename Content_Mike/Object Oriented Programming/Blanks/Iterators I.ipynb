    "In this lecture, we'll discuss iterators in some detail. We've already seen the keyword iteration, referring to constructs like for- and while-loops. Colloquially, an iterable is an object that can be \"for-looped\" over, and an iterator is the companion object which does so. In this lecture, we'll look into the operation of for-loops in a bit more detail, and define a custom iterators with novel behavior.\n",
