    "# Unit Testing\n",
    "How do you know that your function or class behaves correctly? One very natural way to check for correct behavior is to try a few test cases, and compare the result to your expectation. You've been informally doing this throughout this course. In these lecture notes, we'll discuss a formal and automated way to approach testing your code. This is called unit testing, and refers to the practice of checking that each function and class (i.e. each unit of your program) behaves as you expect. Almost all production code is extensively unit-tested, and often the \"actual\" code is dwarfed by the amount of code used to implement unit tests.\n",

It will then give a summary of the number of failures and the time it took to run the tests. The first line ensures that the unit tests are performed only when running the module as a script, and not when importing the module. "
