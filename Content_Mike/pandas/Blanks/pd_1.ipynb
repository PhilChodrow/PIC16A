    "The `pandas` package for Python offers a set of powerful tools for working with tabular data. The name `pandas` is originally derived from the common term \"panel data.\" While different programmers pronounce the package name in different ways, I prefer to pronounce it like the plural of \"panda [bears]\". I then imagine a small army of bears performing my computations for me. \n",
