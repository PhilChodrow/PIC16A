    "One of the fundamental tasks in exploratory data analysis is to summarize your data **by group**. In our penguins data, for example, a very natural thing to do is to compute summary statistics **by species**, or perhaps by habitat (or both!). We can contextualize this task in three stages: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split** the data data frame into pieces, one for each species. \n",
    "2. **Apply** an aggregation function to each piece, yielding a single number. \n",
    "3. **Combine** the results into a new data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is so common that the phrase \"split-apply-combine\" now appears in many texts on data analysis. This phrase was originally coined by Hadley Wickham, who is famous for developing many of the modern tools for data analysis in the `R` programming language. \n",

For example, how can I get the mean bill length for Chinstrap penguins on Dream island? To extract this kind of data, we need to use hierarchical indexing, in which we pass multiple keys to the .loc attribute. After passing all the row indices, we need to use .loc again to get at the column indices."
