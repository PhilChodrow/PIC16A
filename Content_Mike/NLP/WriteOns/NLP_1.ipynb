    "# Natural Language Processing: The Term-Document Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we've already seen a few examples of working with text. We've used basic string operations and `pandas` `str` operations in order to manipulate text data. Now that we have some array programming and machine learning skills under our belt, we can take our exploration of text data much further. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll introduce one of the most important constructs for analyzing text data: the [term-document matrix.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "This might sound intimidating, but the idea is very simple. Consider the following three sentences. We regard each of them as a \"document.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  This is the first one.\n",
    "2.  This one is the second one.\n",
    "3.  Is this the first one?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the term-document matrix as a data frame with a column for each possible word. In each column, we count up how many times that word appears in document. For example, using the three short \"documents\" above, the term-document matrix is: \n",
    "\n",
    "| document | This | is | the | first | one | second |\n",
    "|----------|------|----|-----|-------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| 1        |  1   | 1  |  1  |   1   |  1  |   0    |\n",
    "| 2        | 1    | 1  | 1   |   0   |  2  |   1    |\n",
    "| 3        |  1   | 1  |  1  |   1   |  1  |   0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be an extremely convenient format for working with text data, and we'll see in coming lectures how to use it for both sentiment analysis (figuring out how \"positive\" a word or sentence is) and topic modeling (figuring out the main \"ideas\" in a set of documents). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're very persistent, you would be able to make a term-document matrix using a lot of `for`-loops and basic string operations. However, `scikit-learn` offers a much more convenient approach. In this lecture, we'll see an example of organizing our data and constructing the term-document matrix. In coming lectures, we'll start to use our construction for data analysis. "

    "\n",
    "In many applications, it is desirable to use not the raw number of times that a word appears. Instead, various normalizations are possible, each of which provide a quantification of how important a word is within a document. For example, one could compute what proportion of a document is allocated to each word. This approach automatically accounts for the fact that some documents are longer than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular way to normalize is slightly more mathematically complex: it is called [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). We can compute a tf-idf term-document matrix easily, replacing the `CountVectorizer` above with the `TfidfVectorizer`. "
