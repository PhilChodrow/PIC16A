    "1. Your function should work **whenever `m_rows*m_cols` is equal to the total number of groups.** Your function should first check that this is the case, and raise an informative `ValueError` if not. You may assume that there is at least one data point for each group label in the data supplied. \n",
    "2. For full credit, you should not loop over the individual entries of `groups` or `data`. It is acceptable to loop over the distinct values of `groups`. In general, aim to minimize `for`-loops and maximize use of `Numpy` indexing. \n",
    "2. Use of `pandas` is acceptable but unnecessary, and is unlikely to make your solution significantly simpler. \n",
    "2. You should include a horizontal axis label (of your choice) along **only the bottom row** of axes. \n",
    "3. You should include a vertical axis label (e.g. \"Frequency\") along **only the leftmost column of axes.**\n",
    "4. Each axis should have an axis title of the form \"Group X\", as shown above. \n",
    "5. Comments and docstrings! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your plots look \"squished,\" then `plt.tight_layout()` is sometimes helpful. Just call it after constructing your figure, with no arguments. \n",
    "- Integer division `i // j` and remainders `i % j` are helpful here, although other solutions are also possible. \n"
