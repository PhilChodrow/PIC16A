    "### PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most important website on the internet? Who is the \"key player\" on a sports team? Which countries are the most central players in the world economy? There is no one correct answer to any of these questions, but there is a most profitable one. [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is an algorithm for ranking individual elements of complex systems, invited by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. It was the first and most famous algorithm used by the Google Search engine, and it is fair to say that the internet as we know it today would not exist without PageRank. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will implement PageRank. There are many good ways to implement this algorithm, but in this assignment we will use our newfound skills with object-oriented programming and iterators. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this example, let's assume that we are talking about webpages. PageRank works by allowing a \"random surfer\" to move around webpages by following links. Each time the surfer lands on a page, it then looks for all the links on that page. It then picks one at random and follows it, thereby arriving at the next page, where the process repeats. Eventually, the surfer will visit all the pages one or more times. Pages that the surfer visits more frequently have higher *PageRank scores*. Because the surfer moves between linked pages, PageRank expresses an intuitive idea: **important pages are linked to other important pages.** [This diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#/media/File:PageRanks-Example.jpg) from Wikipedia gives a nice illustration. Note that more important webpages (higher PageRank) tend to be connected to other important webpages. \n",

    "You can complete this assignment using data from one of two sources. \n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The good folks at [The Hamilton Project](http://hamilton.newtfire.org/) analyzed the script for us, obtaining data on **who talks about whom** in each of the show's songs. When character A mentions character B, we'll think of this as a *link* from A to B, suggesting that B might be important. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use this data set, listening to the soundtrack while working is strongly recommended. \n",

    "\n",
    "## (A). Define Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, all you have to do is hit `shift + enter` on the code block supplied below. This block defines two functions. The first one retrieves the data from the internet and saves it to your local computer, while the second reads in the data, producing a list of tuples. It's not important for you to be familiar with the code in these functions right now -- we'll discuss them early in Week 4. "
