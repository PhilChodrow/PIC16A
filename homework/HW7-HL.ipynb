A patient in the 85th percentile, for example, received a risk score from the algorithm higher than 84% of all patients and lower than 15% of all patients. The raw risk score (not the percentile) of each patient is contained in the `risk_score_t` column. \n",
    "- **The horizontal axis gives the average number of chronic illnesses presented by patients in the corresponding risk percentile**. For example, White men in the 80th risk score percentile presented, on average, approximately two chronic illnesses. The number of chronic illnesses presented by a patient is contained in the `\"gagne_sum_t\"` column of the data. \n",

    "5. Perform a train-test split of `X` and `y`, using 20% of the data as test data. Please pass the argument `random_state = 2021` to your split function in order to ensure reproducibility. **Important**: you should do this using only one function call. \n",

    "    - Training score: `0.12629789734544883`\n",
    "    - Testing score: `0.12415443228313183`\n",
    "7. Based these results, comment on whether you are concerned about overfitting. **Note**: these are not \"accuracy\" scores but rather \"coefficient of determination\" scores. They are relatively low, but low scores on statistical tasks are common in medical and biological applications. \n",
    "8. Examine the `coef_` attribute of the fitted linear regression model. The `race` column is the first one in the data frame. This means that the very first entry of the `coef_` array gives the model's estimate of the difference in costs between White and Black patients when controlling for sex, age, and medical conditions. Here's what I got -- it's ok if your answer is a little different: \n",
    "    - Coefficient of `race`: `579.9031747777375`. \n",
