    "Sentiment analysis is a very common tool in business marketing, where it can be useful to examine, say, the sentiment of tweets in response to your ad. Within research, one of the most famous sentiment analysis projects is the [**Hedonometer**](https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/) from the Computational Story Lab at the University of Vermont. Their analysis suggests that the summer of 2020, amidst a pandemic and controversy over police brutality, has been one of the true low points of the last decade -- at least on Twitter, where they collect their data. \n",

It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.
