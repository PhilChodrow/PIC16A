You should not capture any of the additional HTML tags. Feel free to take the list of examples above, and paste it in [Pythex](https://pythex.org/) to experiment with your expression. Once you've settled on your solution, import the `re` module and use `re.findall` to obtain all character names. At this stage, you should have repeats: for example, there are 23 distinct speeches by the character `BERNARDO`. Save your results as a list called `speeches`. "
