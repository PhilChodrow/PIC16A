    "# Discussion Activity: Ulam Spirals\n",
    "\n",
    "An Ulam spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers with intriguing geometrical patterns. This depiction was created by the famous mathematician Stanisław Ulam. Ulam is better known for several of his other creations, including the design of the hydrogen bomb and the invention of Monte Carlo methods for simulating stochastic processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create an Ulam spiral, start by arranging the integers in spiral grid: <br><br>\n",

    "Note several diagonal and vertical lines with high densities of black dots. These geometrical structures remain only partially understood, and are connected to several important open problems in the theory of the prime numbers. \n",

    "## What We'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "In this discussion activity, we will write a generator which supports \"spiral\" iteration: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, j, k in spiral(5):\n",
    "    print(i,j,k)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2 2 1\n",
    "    3 2 2\n",
    "    3 1 3\n",
    "    2 1 4\n",
    "    1 1 5\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two numbers give the **coordinates** of a square, while the third number gives the integer corresponding to that square. For example, the number `1` corresponds to `(2,2)`, the number `4` corresponds to `(2,1)`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start at `(2,2)` because this is the middle of a `5x5` grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to compare to the first diagram to convince yourself that this generator is doing what you would expect. "

    "### Part (A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a grid `G`, represented as a list of `n` lists, each of which contains `n` entries equal to `0`. This can be done in a single line using a double list comprehension. Start by setting `n = 5` (for now). \n",

    "### Part (B)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to implement the `spiral()` generator. If you investigate the first diagram in this assignment, you'll observe that, after starting in the middle, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We take **one** step right, then turn left (so now we are facing up). We take **one** step up, then turn left again (so now we are facing left). \n",
    "2. Then, we take **two** steps left, then turn left (so now we are facing down). We then take **two** steps down, then turn left (so now we are facing right). \n",
    "3. Then, we take **three** steps...\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our approach is to implement this behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `spiral()` should accept a single argument `n`, an odd integer. Check that `n` is an integer, and raise a `TypeError` if not. Then, check that `n` is *odd*, and raise a `ValueError` if not. \n",
    "1. Start with a variable  `pos = (m,m)`, where `m = int(n-1)/2` is the midpoint of the grid. Additionally, initialize a variable `k = 1` to log the current integer, and a *direction* tuple with `(0,1)` indicating the direction we are facing. Finally, initialize a `length` variable with value `1`. \n",
    "2. **Main loop:**\n",
    "    1. As long as `k <= n**2 - 1`\n",
    "        1. Do the following twice (that is, do i and ii, then do i and ii again). \n",
    "            1. Take a number of steps equal to `length`. In a step, we add the current `direction` to the current position `pos` entrywise. After each step, if `k <= n**2`, yield `(pos[0], pos[1], k)`, then increment `k` by one. \n",
    "            2. Change direction by making a left turn. You can do so by replacing `direction` with its value in the supplied `left_turns` dictionary. \n",
    "        2. Increment length by 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"main part\" of the activity, so it's ok to spend some extra time here. \n",
