    "This Discussion activity is a component of your [group mini-project](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/project/). While the usual Discussion expectations apply with regards to your participation grade (i.e. if you work for the full 50 minutes, you will get full credit), it is recommended for the purposes of your final project that you coordinate with your group to eventually complete all parts of this assignment. \n",

    "## Group Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The roles for this Discussion activity are slightly modified. The Driver and Proposer are the same as usual. Instead of a Reviewer, use an **Interpreter**. The job of the Interpreter is to think about the significance of each of the code outputs in the context of the long-term project goal (classifying penguin species). In parts of the Discussion where the problems ask you to explain or interpret your findings, the Interpreter should suggest responses to the Proposer and Driver. The **Interpreter** may also give code feedback when the group is writing functions. \n",
