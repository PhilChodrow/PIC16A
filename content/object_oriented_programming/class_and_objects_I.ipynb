    "Like C++, Python is an **object-oriented** programming language. While the idea of object-orientation is somewhat difficult to define, a fairly general rule of thumb is that the right solution to complex problems in Python often involves creating one or more **objects**, which you can think of as bundles of related data and behaviors. \n",

    "A **class** defines an abstract set of possible objects sharing certain characteristics. For example, \"dog\" would be a good candidate for a class. There are many dogs, all of which have the same species. On the other hand, \"my dog\" refers to a single dog, who could be an **instance** in this class. \n",
