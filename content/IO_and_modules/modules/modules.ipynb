    "In this offering of PIC16A, we have primarily done our coding in the Jupyter Notebook interface, which emphasizes interactivity and exploratory coding. Another useful skill is writing and using your own modules (i.e. `.py` files), which can hold useful classes and functions that you would like to reuse. In this lecture, we'll go into some more detail on how to create and use modules.\n",

    "At core, the `import` keyword is just a fancy way to run the code in one or more `.py` files -- the main difference is that the `import` keyword will additionally assign objects and functions created within those files to the module's namespace. That is, a function `f` defined in module `m` will have name `m.f`. We've seen ways to use `from` and `as` to further manipulate how names are organized. \n",

    "\n",
    "When you have many hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of lines of code, you don't want to put them all in the same `.py` file. Instead, it's common to split these up into multiple files. A **package** is a directory structure containing multiple modules, alongside a special `__init__.py` file that tells the Python interpreter that the files in the given directory should be treated as modules. These directories can be arbitrarily nested.  \n",
