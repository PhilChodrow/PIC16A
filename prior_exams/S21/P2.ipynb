    "> *I certify on my honor that I have neither given nor received any help, or used any non-permitted resources, while completing this evaluation.*\n",

    "\n",
    "## Permitted Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam is open-book, open-notes, open-internet, open-everything. The only thing you are not allowed to do is ask another human being for help, with the exception of me. Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Permitted**: Checking course notes and videos; browsing Google or StackOverflow; consulting previous Campuswire posts. \n",
    "2. **Not permitted**: Requesting help on Chegg; publicly posting on Campuswire (messages to me are ok); privately asking classmates for help; posting on StackOverflow. \n",

    "1. Write down everything relevant that you know about the problem, as comments where your code would go. \n",
    "2. If you have non-functioning code that demonstrates some correct ideas, indicate that and keep it (commented out). \n",

    "## A Note on Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "There is precisely **one** place in this entire problem in which a loop (such as a `for`-loop, a `while`-loop, or a list comprehension) is completely appropriate. This place is **Part D**. I'll tell you when we get there. With that one exception, you should avoid the use of loops whenever possible. Solutions that use loops elsewhere will receive partial credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Concision and Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, *concision and style* are two of the criteria on which we assess your solutions. You should aim to write code that is as short, simple, and readable as possible. My own solution for this problem requires 21 lines excluding comments. Longer solutions are ok, as long as they don't perform redundant computation and appropriately make use of Numpy operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments and Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments and docstrings are not required** in any part of this problem. However,they may help us give you partial credit, so they are recommended unless you're feeling very confident. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is not necessary to perform any input checking** in this problem -- you can assume that the user will supply inputs with the correct data types, shapes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "**It's ok for your images to look a little different from mine.** For example, your image might appear slightly jagged or blocky, depending on the size of your background `Canvas`. That's ok! As long as your image clearly demonstrates correct code, you'll receive full credit. "

    "    - At this stage, the `__init__` method should create an instance variable `self.im`, a Numpy array of shape `(n, n, 3)`. This array should be constructed so that `self.im[i,j] == background` for each value of `i` and `j`. \n",
