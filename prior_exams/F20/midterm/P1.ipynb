Each problem is divided into multiple parts, some of which may be completed independently of others. The exam is intended to require approximately 90 minutes, and may be worked on at any time between the hours of 12:00am and 11:59, Pacific Time, on Friday, October 30th. You are free to work on the exam in excess of 90 minutes during this time period. \n",

Write the code that you would expect to run if part (A) were working. Explicitly state that you are unable to test your code in (B) because you couldn't get (A) to run.
