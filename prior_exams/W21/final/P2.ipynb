    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are a wealthy venture capitalist, considering whether to invest in a new tech startup company. The startup is called TNNT (pronounced \"tenant\"). The startup aims to accelerate the speed at which landlords are able to find tenants to rent apartments. The founder claims that their proprietary algorithm can be used to identify \"high-quality,\" reliable applicants to whom landlords would like to rent apartments, while screening out \"low-quality\" applicants. This reduces the number of applications that the landlord will have to read, thus saving the landlord time. The founder hopes that landlords will pay a small fee to use the service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the algorithm works: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Melanie and Xenith submit an application on TNNT.com, providing basic information about their jobs and income. \n",
    "2. TNNT's proprietary algorithm produces a *score* for Melanie and Xenith's application, based on the information they provided. Let's say their score is 0.87. This score is intended to reflect the probability that the landlord will approve their application. \n",
    "3. Only scores above 0.80 are supplied to the landlord for a final decision. So, the landlord will receive and evaluate Melanie and Xenith's application, but not Roberto and Darrell's application which received only a 0.63. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value for the landlord is that they will receive a smaller number of high-quality applications, as measured by the TNNT algorithm. This saves the landlord time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A few technical details.** The training data for the TNNT algorithm is a large collection of the decisions of landlords from Los Angeles. Each piece of training data includes the name of the applicant(s), information about their job(s), and information about their income. You can think of this information as the predictor data `X`. It also includes an indication about whether the application was ultimately approved by the landlord. You can think of this information as the target data `y`. TNNT collects recent landlord decisions, and uses them to update the model.  \n",

    "Below, please respond briefly to the following questions. **Two sentences each is plenty**, although it's fine if you want to write more. \n",

    "***Note***: the definitions of *measurement bias* and *historical bias* are from Rachel Thomas's [video](https://youtu.be/S-6YGPrmtYc) that we watched for lecture, \"Getting Specific About Algorithmic Bias.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is a potential source of *measurement bias* in the TNNT algorithm? \n",
    "    - (*Hint*: compare what the founder says the algorithm measures compared to the data the algorithm actually uses). \n",
    "2. What is a potential source of *historical bias* in the TNNT algorithm? \n",
    "    - It is not necessary (though it is perfectly fine) to connect your answer to actual history. You may, for example, assume that people with an odd number of letters in English first name constitute a historically oppressed group, if that will help you explain your example. \n",
    "3. What is an example of a *feedback loop* that might amplify bias in the TNNT algorithm over time? "
